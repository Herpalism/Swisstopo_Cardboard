GazeClick 
Google VR / Google Cardboard Extension for Timed Reticle
(c) 2016 Ateo GmbH

GazeClick adds a simple timed click functionality to the Reticle from the GoogleVR Plugin for Unity.
When the user looks at an interactive object, the timed cursor starts and as soon as the animation is finished, a click is simulated. This enables completely gaze-controlled VR experiences without any additional input.
